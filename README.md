# Tiny-Emder5Plus
Core-XY topper for an ender 5+ built from the Tiny-M https://github.com/gsl12/Tiny-M

The Y axis is flipped, but the printed plastics have not changed from the Tiny-M. 

Different bits required from the Tiny-M:
* Longer bolts (Some of the M5x40 will need to be M5x60 because they now also have to pass through some of the 2020 extrusion to go into the end of the 2020 below.
* longer pulleys
* extra braces for motor mounts (Will upload CAD when I design them)
* will need two identical motors for AB motors. The ender X and Y motors are diferent, so you could try and sorce a single one of either. I'm personally probably just going to buy two matched motors. Probably whatever is used on the Voron 2

Bit not required from the Tiny-M:
* Z axis
* much of the extrusions
* some of the hardware

I'm going to build mine with the stock Ender 5 plus board and Raspberry Pi running Klipper. In theory you should be able to run almost any main board (BTT etc) with klipper, but if you do, you are own your own. Who knows if I can even figure out the config for myself... 

Untested, and unfinished.

Ender 5 CAD shamelessly mooched from https://grabcad.com/library/creality-ender-5-plus-1
